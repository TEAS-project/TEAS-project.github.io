  <h1>Our Goal</h1>
  We aim to create a suite of next-generation benchmarks that track the fast-evolving landscape of AI, and measure the complex trade-offs across costs, accuracy, and performance on a range of state-of-the-art hardware.

  <h1>Our Approach</h1>
  Our approach is informed by two selection maps (one for models and the other for systems), with a broad team with extensive expertise in AI research and practice â€“ a combination that allows for rapid evolution of the benchmarks.
